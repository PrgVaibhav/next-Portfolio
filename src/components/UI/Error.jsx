          Well, this is awkward. It seems I've misplaced a page somewhere in the
          vast internet wilderness. Don't worry; I've sent out a search party
          (a.k.a. me frantically checking my code) to bring it back.
        </p>
        <p>While you wait, here's a little joke to lighten the mood:</p>

        <p>Why did my webpage go to therapy?</p>
        <p>Because it had too many issues with its past! ðŸ˜„</p>

        <p>Thanks for your patience, and sorry for the inconvenience!</p>
