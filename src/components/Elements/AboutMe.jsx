            Hello, I'm Vaibhav, a ReactJS Developer with a passion for building
            responsive and beautiful websites. I completed my graduation in 2023
            withÂ BCA (Bachelor's in Computer Application).

          <p>
            I enjoy building websites that are both beautiful and user-friendly.
            I believe in simplicity and minimalism and enjoy bringing that mood
            into every project I touch.
          </p>
